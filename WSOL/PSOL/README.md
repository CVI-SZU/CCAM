### Train a regressor using the psuedo bboxes extracted from CCAM
#### Split train and test set
```shell
python3 train_test_split.py --data_dir path/to/your/dataset
```
#### CUB-200-2011, plase specify the path to dataset and pseudo bboxes and type of backbone in `run_cub.sh`. For convenience, we provide the pretrained classifier (efficientnetb7) on CUB at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvtrT-TybVDBkYmRpWeAU4i0l3xLo10V/view?usp=sharing) and put it on the current directory.

```
bash run_cub.sh
```
#### ILSVRC2012, plase specify the path to dataset and pseudo bboxes and type of backbone in `run_ilsvrc.sh`. Download the gt bboxes for validation at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D501nKfJ2TZGoHqj0neNL93G4R8Knd4b/view?usp=sharing) and put it on the current directory.

```
bash run_ilsvrc.sh
```

**Please note that** we specify ResNet50 as default backbone to prevent the problem of OOM. If you have enough GPUs, please specify more gpu numbers in 'run_xx.sh'. In our experiments, we use **two tesla A100** to train a regressor with a backbone of DenseNet161.

**Pretrained weights are available at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Uoyh3XLdz5VqWvWNjxoqMfRryu1nkQTL?usp=sharing)**
