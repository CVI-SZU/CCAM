# C2AM (Unsupervised)
## Update (2022-12-12)
We update the evaluation results using ResNet50 as both localization and classfication backbone. Table is also updated in our [Arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13505).

## Dataset

### CUB-200-2011

You will need to download the images (JPEG format) in CUB-200-2011 dataset
from [here](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html). Make sure your ```data/CUB_200_2011``` folder is structured as
follows:

```

|   ├── images
|   ├── images.txt
|   ├── bounding_boxes.txt
|   ...
|   └── train_test_split.txt
```

You will need to download the images (JPEG format) in ILSVRC2012 dataset from [here](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/).
Make sure your ```data/ILSVRC2012``` folder is structured as follows:

### ILSVRC2012

```
├── ILSVRC2012/ 
|   ├── train
|   ├── val
|   ├── val_boxes
|   |   ├——val
|   |   |   ├—— ILSVRC2012_val_00050000.xml
|   |   |   ├—— ...
|   ├── train.txt
|   └── val.txt
```

### PASCAL VOC2012

You will need to download the images (JPEG format) in PASCAL VOC2012 dataset from [here](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/).
Make sure your ```data/VOC2012``` folder is structured as follows:

```
├── VOC2012/
|   ├── Annotations
|   ├── ImageSets
|   ├── SegmentationClass
|   ├── SegmentationClassAug
|   └── SegmentationObject
```

## CUSTOM DATASET

As CCAM is an unsupervised method, it can be applied to various scenarios, like ReID, Saliency detection, or skin lesion detection. We provide an example to apply CCAM on your custom dataset like 'Market-1501'.

```
cd CUSTOM
```
